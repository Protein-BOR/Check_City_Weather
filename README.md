# Python Weather App (PyQt5)

This is a simple desktop GUI weather application built using Python and PyQt5.  
It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input (city name).

This project was built with guidance from a YouTube tutorial and customized to improve design, layout, and error handling.  
It served as a learning experience for working with GUI frameworks and APIs in Python.
